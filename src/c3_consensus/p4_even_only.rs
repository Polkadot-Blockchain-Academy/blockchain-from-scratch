//! In the previous chapter, we considered a hypothetical scenario where blocks must contain an even
//! state root in order to be valid. Now we will express that logic here as a higher-order consensus
//! engine. It is higher- order because it will wrap an inner consensus engine, such as PoW or PoA
//! and work in either case.
