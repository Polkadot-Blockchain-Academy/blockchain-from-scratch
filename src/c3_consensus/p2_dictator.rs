//! The Dictator consensus engine considers any header valid as long as it is signed by the
//! dictator. The "signature" is made by simply attaching one of the Consensus Authorities from the
//! root of this module.
//!
//! Throughout this chapter we will avoid performing _Actual_ cryptographic calculations because
//! they require a crypto library which and overcoming its own learning curve, plus they distract
//! from the underlying consensus-related logic. Instead, we just use the `ConsensusAuthority` enum
//! from the module root.

/// Dictator consensus is an identity-based consensus algorithm. It specifies a single dictator
