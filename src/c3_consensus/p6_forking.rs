//! We saw in the previous chapter that blockchain communities sometimes opt to modify the
//! consensus rules from time to time. This process is knows as a fork. Here we implement
//! a higher-order consensus engine that allows such forks to be made.
//!
//! The consensus engine we implement here does not contain the specific consensus rules to
//! be enforced before or after the fork, but rather delegates to existing consensus engines
//! for that. Here we simply write the logic for detecting whether we are before or after the fork.
