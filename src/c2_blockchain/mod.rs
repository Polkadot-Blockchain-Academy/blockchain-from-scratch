//! This module explores the blockchain. A distributed hash-linked tree-like data structure that is
//! used to track alternative histories of a shared resource. It also explores a simple work-based
//! consensus algorithm to help users decide which history is the canonical one.

// We make the complete Block and Header types publicly visible so that we can continue developing
// against them in future chapters. The prior iterations are not available outside this chapter.
