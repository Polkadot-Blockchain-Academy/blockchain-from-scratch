//! Forks in the blockchain represent alternative histories of the system.

//! Since we have nothing to add to the Block or Header data structures in this lesson,

// This lesson has omitted one popular fork choice rule:
// GHOST - Greedy Heaviest Observed SubTree
//
// I've omitted GHOST from here because it requires information about blocks that
// are _not_ in the chain to decide which chain is best. Therefore it does't work
// well with this relatively simple trait definition. We will return to the GHOST
// rule later when we have written a full blockchain client
//
// The GHOST rule was first published in 2013 by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar.
