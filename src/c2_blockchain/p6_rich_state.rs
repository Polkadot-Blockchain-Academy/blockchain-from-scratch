//! In this lesson we expand our simple notion of state, and show how the state is typically not
//! stored in the header, Or indeed anywhere in the block at all.
//!
//! To facilitate this exercise, consider that we want our blockchain to store not only the sum of
//! the extrinsics, but also the product. You can also imagine many other calculations the chain may
//! want to track (min, max, median, mean, etc).
//!
//! As the state data gets large, it is no longer reasonable to store it in the blocks. But if the
//! state isn't in the blocks, then how can we perform the state-related validation checks we
//! previously performed? We use a state root to cryptographically link our heder to a complete
//! state.
//!
//! This notion of state may sound familiar from our previous work on state machines. Indeed this
//! naming coincidence foreshadows a key abstraction that we will make in a coming chapter.
